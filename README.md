# **What I Learned in Week 9**

### Display Grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

* An HTML element becomes a grid container when its display property is set to grid <br/><br/>
  div {<br/>display: grid <br/>}

* The **grid-template-columns** property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout. The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.

* The **grid-template-rows** property specifies the number (and the heights) of the rows in a grid layout. The values are a space-separated list, where each value specifies the height of the respective row.
* The **grid-column** property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout.
* The **grid-row** property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout.
